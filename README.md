A big flood

- I've uploaded a copy of th file I used to create my master sheet and just uploaded the final doc rather than all the individual ones used to make it. I doubt I'll include the whole process of how I made the master sheet but I can check with tristan if we need to include how we went from the raw data. 

Now sure what your thoughts are for the structure of it buta suggestion -Maybe add a fourth one to link stuff together at the end to compare flood events? Not sure... 

Repository structure: 
- 1 notebook per section/research question? E.g.: 
- When are the major flood events? Plot longer time series (from presentation). For each flood event, basic analysis of how each parameter changes over the month period. 
- Correlations and how different parameters relate to one another 
- How th flood moves through space (particle tracing)
