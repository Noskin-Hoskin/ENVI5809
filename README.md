# Assessing the spatio-temporal variability of ocean chemistry changes along flood plumes from the Burdekin River 

This study aims to assess the spatial and temporal variability of AIMS eReefs hydrodynamic and biogeochemical parameters of water quality relevant to coral health before, during, and after a flood plume event originating from the Burdekin River catchment.

The analysis process has been undertaken in 3 parts:
1. Assessing the long term temporal variability of salinity, pH, aragonite saturation state & coral symbiont chlorophyll, in order to identify major peaks/troughs associated with flood event.
2. Creating passive tracing maps to track the development of selected parameters alongside the spatial and temporal progression of the 2019 flood event.
3. Quantitative assesment of the interactions between variables at selected reef sites during the 2019 flood event.
